# Code for training and evaluating SGD model with GuassianCopulaSynthesizer synthetic data

- `GaussianCopulaSynthesizer.ipynb`: generate synthetic data, train + evaluate SGD trained on real data, synthetic data, and a combination of real and synthetic
- `midterm_sgd_code.ipynb`: real data only was used in the midterm to assess the performance of SGD on predicting gender class 3
