# Code for training and evaluating random forest models with CTGAN synthetic data
- 'Train_Random_Forest_Original_Data.ipynb': Evaluate the random forest model trained on the real data. This code determines the most important features for the random forest and determines the utility of the model trained on these features with appropriate plots.
- 'Train_Random_Forest_CTGAN.ipynb': Generate synthetic data using CTGAN. Evaluate the random forest model trained on synthetic data or a combination of real and synthetic data. Utility, Fidelity, and Privacy are assessed with appropriate plots.
- 'Train_Random_Forest_PrivBayes': Leverage synthetic data generated by PrivBayes to evaluate the random forest model. The model utility is tested on real data, synthetic data, or a combination of real and synthetic data.
